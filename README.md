# CHEM-5630
The code is stored in a Jupyter notebook called " Motley Final".

The name of the project is Motley final because this set of code contains three unrelated functions. 

The first function (EOC) extracts Equilibrium Geometry Coordinate data from .log files provided in CHEM 5630 and writes the data into a text file.

The second function (mAA) takes a strand of mRNA and returns an array of the corresponding amino acid chain.

The third function (CDNAS) allows the input of a DNA strand and returns the complementary DNA strand and also writes the complementary strand into a text file.
